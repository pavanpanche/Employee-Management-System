# Employee Management System: (CRUD Operations)

## 📋 Project Overview

The **Employee Management System** is a console-based application built using **Core Java**. It allows users to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on employee data using Java Collections (e.g., `ArrayList`). This mini-project is ideal for Java beginners looking to understand basic object-oriented concepts and data handling techniques in Java.
